### Inital prompt: 
```
Create web browser based PacMan game, use react and vite
```
### build fix: 
```
when I attemt to run command:
npm run build

I get:
npm ERR! Missing script: "build"

please fix
```

Done — I fixed the missing "build" script and verified the production build.

What I changed

Updated root package.json (/workspaces/vite-tst/package.json)
Added scripts that delegate to the inner package:
build -> npm --prefix pacman-vite-react run build
dev/start -> npm --prefix pacman-vite-react run dev
preview -> npm --prefix pacman-vite-react run serve
deploy -> npm --prefix pacman-vite-react run deploy
This lets you run npm run build (or npm run dev) from the repo root and have it run the PacMan app's commands.
Updated package.json
Added devDependency: @vitejs/plugin-react (required by vite.config.ts).
Created src/components/GameBoard.css (a minimal stylesheet referenced by GameBoard.tsx) so the Vite build doesn't fail on a missing import.
Installed dependencies for pacman-vite-react (so vite and the plugin are available).
Ran the build and fixed the next failure iteratively.
Verification (what I ran)

Installed pacman package deps:
npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react install --no-audit --no-fund
Built the app:
npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react run build
Output: build completed successfully and dist/ was produced.
Also confirmed you can now run the delegated command from repo root:
npm run build (runs the script added to root package.json)
Notes, warnings and next steps

During build there were warnings about images referenced from src/styles/globals.css:
"../assets/sprites/pacman.png" and "../assets/sprites/ghost.png" were not resolved at build time and will be left unresolved to be resolved at runtime.
To avoid that warning, either:
Import those images from components via import pacman from '@/assets/sprites/pacman.png' and use as URLs, or
Put the sprites in public/ and reference them as /assets/sprites/pacman.png.
I added a minimal GameBoard.css. Style and layout still need work to match Pac-Man behavior/visuals.
If you'd like, I can:
Move sprite images to public/ and update CSS, or
Add full game logic (movement, collision, ghosts) and polish visuals, or
Wire up a npm run build CI step and GH Pages deploy workflow.
Files changed/added

Modified: package.json (root) — added delegation scripts
Modified: package.json — added @vitejs/plugin-react devDependency
Added: GameBoard.css — minimal styles
How you can run locally

From repo root:
npm run dev # runs vite dev server for pacman-vite-react
npm run build # builds pacman-vite-react (creates dist/)
Or directly in the pacman package:
cd pacman-vite-react
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
Status (quality gates)

Build: PASS (production build completed and dist/ created)
Lint/Typecheck: not run (you can request this next)
Tests: not run (no test changes were required)
If you want, next I'll:

Move sprites into public/ and update globals.css so those warnings disappear, and/or
Start implementing core game features (movement, pellets, ghost AI) in the src components—tell me which you'd prefer.



```
npm run deploy
command fals with error:
npm ERR! Missing script: "deploy"
```

Summary and fix

What I found

The error "Missing script: 'deploy'" happened because the root package.json contained invalid/incorrect script entries (comments and a trailing comma) and the inner package (package.json) had predeploy and deploy at the top level instead of inside the scripts object. npm therefore couldn't find a runnable deploy script.
What I changed

Fixed root package.json (made valid JSON) and made deploy delegate to the inner package:
"deploy": "npm --prefix pacman-vite-react run deploy"
Also kept build, dev, start, preview, predeploy delegations.
Moved predeploy and deploy into pacman-vite-react's scripts object (they were incorrectly top-level).
Added gh-pages to pacman-vite-react dependencies so the gh-pages binary is present when deploying.
Installed dependencies for pacman-vite-react and ran the deploy flow to verify.
What I ran (verification)

Installed new deps:
npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react install --no-audit --no-fund
Verified deploy (ran in pacman package):
npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react run deploy
Output: built the project and gh-pages reported "Published"
You can also run from repo root (delegates to inner package):
npm run deploy
Notes and warnings

During the build there were warnings about images in src/styles/globals.css:
"../assets/sprites/pacman.png" and "../assets/sprites/ghost.png" weren't resolved at build time (left for runtime). To silence this and have assets baked into the build, either:
Move those sprite files to public and reference them with absolute paths (e.g., /assets/sprites/pacman.png), or
Import images from code (import pacman from '@/assets/sprites/pacman.png') so Vite processes them.
Deploy succeeded (gh-pages published). If you didn't intend to publish, the deploy step will push to gh-pages branch — be careful.
Files changed

package.json — cleaned and added delegation scripts
package.json — moved predeploy/deploy into scripts and added gh-pages dependency
Installed packages under node_modules
How you can run locally

From repo root:
npm run dev # start dev server
npm run build # build inner package (creates dist/)
npm run deploy # runs predeploy/build then publishes via gh-pages
Or directly in package:
cd pacman-vite-react
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run deploy
If you want next

I can:
Move sprite images to public/ and update CSS to remove the build-time warnings.
Implement or continue implementing the Pac-Man game logic and polish visuals/controls.
Add a safe deploy:dry script that builds but doesn't publish, for testing.
Which of those (or anything else) would you like me to do next?


```
when testing deployed website, I got following error:
Uncaught Error: Minified React error #200; visit https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=200 for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.
render https://mistrzunio.github.io/vite-tst/assets/index-14eef164.js:40
<anonymous> https://mistrzunio.github.io/vite-tst/assets/index-14eef164.js:40
index-14eef164.js:40:56609
```

Thanks — I tracked down the error and fixed it.

Root cause

The deployed app threw React minified error #200 because React attempted to mount into a container that didn't exist in the HTML.
Your main.tsx was mounting to document.getElementById('root') but index.html had <div id="app"></div>. In production React throws a minified invariant; that shows up as error #200 in the minified build.
What I changed to fix it

Updated index.html to use <div id="root"></div>.
Updated main.tsx to use React 18's createRoot API and to throw a clear error if the container is missing.
Added @types/react and @types/react-dom devDeps (TypeScript declarations) to avoid type errors during development.
Rebuilt the project to verify the fix (build completed successfully).
Verification

I ran a production build successfully:
pacman-vite-react dist was produced and build completed.
After these fixes, the invalid container situation (the exact cause of minified error #200) is resolved.
What to do next (options)

Redeploy the fixed build to your site (if you want me to, I can run the deploy now).
Or test locally:
Start dev server (non-minified React gives full errors and warnings):

npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react run dev
Open the dev server and test in your browser; you’ll see full React errors (not minified) if any remain.
Build locally:

npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react run build
Deploy:

npm run deploy    # from repo root (delegates to pacman-vite-react)# ornpm --prefix pacman-vite-react run deploy
Notes / small follow-ups I can do

Redeploy the fixed site now (I can run the deploy).
Move sprite images into public or change imports so Vite resolves them at build time (this will silence the build-time warnings about unresolved images).
Sweep other components for potential runtime mismatches (helpful if you plan server-side rendering later).
If you'd like, I can redeploy the fixed build now and confirm the live site no longer shows the React error. Would you like me to do that?

```
yes
```

Done — I redeployed the site and verified the publish step completed.

What I ran (why/what/outcome)

I ran the package deploy which runs the predeploy build and then publishes the dist/ folder:
npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react run deploy
Outcome: build completed and gh-pages reported "Published".
Key terminal output (summary)

Build: vite built the production bundle and created dist/.
Publish: gh-pages printed "Published".
Next steps for you

Open your live site to verify the React error is gone:
https://mistrzunio.github.io/vite-tst/
If you still see the React minified error #200 after this redeploy, please:
Hard-refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) to avoid cached JS.
If it persists, start the dev server locally to see the full (non-minified) React error:

npm --prefix /workspaces/vite-tst/pacman-vite-react run dev
Then open the local dev URL (it will show helpful, unminified errors and a stack trace).
Optional follow-ups I can do now

Move the sprite files into public and update src/styles/globals.css so Vite resolves them at build time and the build warnings disappear.
Run a quick client-side check script (curl) against the deployed HTML to confirm the root div is correct — I can do this if you want (note: it only validates HTML, not JS runtime).
If you still see the React error live, I can inspect the runtime bundle and components locally to find other causes.
Would you like me to:

Open the deployed site and run a quick HTTP fetch/validation from the container, or
Move sprites into public/ to remove build-time warnings, or
Start the dev server and reproduce any remaining errors locally?

```
Open the deployed site and run a quick HTTP fetch/validation from the container
